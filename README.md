# JMAP Webmail

A webmail client for [Stalwart Mail Server](https://stalw.art/), built with Next.js and the JMAP protocol.

## Why Stalwart?

Stalwart is a mail server written in Rust with native JMAP support, not IMAP/SMTP with JMAP added as an afterthought. It handles JMAP, IMAP, SMTP, and ManageSieve. Self-hosted, no third-party dependencies.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A JMAP-compatible mail server ([Stalwart](https://stalw.art/) recommended)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/root-fr/jmap-webmail.git
cd jmap-webmail
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Configuration

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
# App name displayed in the UI
APP_NAME=My Webmail

# Your JMAP server URL (required)
JMAP_SERVER_URL=https://mail.example.com
```

These are runtime environment variables, read at request time. Docker deployments can be configured without rebuilding. Legacy `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables still work as fallbacks.

#### OAuth2/OIDC (optional)

To enable SSO login alongside Basic Auth:

```env
OAUTH_ENABLED=true
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=webmail
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=              # optional, for confidential clients
OAUTH_ISSUER_URL=                 # optional, for external IdPs (Keycloak, Authentik)
```

Endpoints are auto-discovered via `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` or `.well-known/openid-configuration`. If your JMAP server delegates auth to an external IdP, set `OAUTH_ISSUER_URL` to the IdP's base URL (e.g., `https://keycloak.example.com/realms/mail`).

To disable Basic Auth:

```env
OAUTH_ONLY=true
```

#### Remember me (optional)

To enable "Remember me" for Basic Auth login:

```env
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key    # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
```

When set, a "Remember me" checkbox appears on the login form. Credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored in an httpOnly cookie (30-day expiry).

### Development

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm run typecheck  # Type checking
npm run lint       # Linting
```

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Docker

```bash
# Pre-built image
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e JMAP_SERVER_URL=https://mail.example.com rootfr/jmap-webmail:latest

# From GHCR
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e JMAP_SERVER_URL=https://mail.example.com ghcr.io/root-fr/jmap-webmail:latest

# With docker compose
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your JMAP_SERVER_URL
docker compose up -d

# Build from source
docker build -t jmap-webmail .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e JMAP_SERVER_URL=https://mail.example.com jmap-webmail
```
